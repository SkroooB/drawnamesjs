# 💻 DrawNamesJs Node.js App 

A Node.js app that reads a list of names from a text file, draws each name on an image using a specific font, and saves the resulting image as a new file.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SkroooB/drawnamesjs.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Customize the app by modifying the `names.txt`, `input.jpg`, and `cairo.tff` files
4. Run the app: `npm start`

## 📝 Details

The app uses the `canvas` module to draw the text on the image. The font can be customized by replacing the `cairo.tff` file with another font file. The text placement can be customized by modifying the x and y coordinates passed to the `fillText` method.

The app can also generate multiple images from a list of names by looping through the names and creating a new image for each name.
